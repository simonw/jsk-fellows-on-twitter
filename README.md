# jsk-fellows-on-twitter

JSK Fellowship alumni with Twitter accounts

This repository updates https://jsk-fellows.datasettes.com/ once every day.

It uses [twitter-to-sqlite](https://github.com/dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite) to fetch bios of [JSK Fellowship alumni](https://jsk.stanford.edu/fellows/alumni/) that are listed at https://twitter.com/JSKstanford/lists - then deploys a searchable database using [Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette).
